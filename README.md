# Memory-Moving Background Process with Ngrok Connection

This C++ program demonstrates a technique to move itself to memory, start a new background process, and establish a connection to an ngrok tunnel. The code is designed to work on Windows systems.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- `g++` compiler (part of GNU Compiler Collection) installed and properly configured

# Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/Just-Nettings/Bypass-67AVs.git

2. Open a text editor and create a new file.
gedit or nano or vim

3. Copy the provided C++ code into the new file.
in the main.cpp

4. Save the file with a `.cpp` extension. For example, you can save it as `main.cpp`.


5. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window.


6. Navigate to the directory where the `main.cpp` file is located using the `cd` command.


7. Compile the C++ code using the following command:

8. Start an ngrok http Tunnel (e-g ngrok http 80 or 443)
   
   ```shell
   g++ -o main.exe main.cpp
This command will generate an executable file named main.exe.

Run the compiled executable by typing its name and pressing Enter:

shell
Copy
main.exe
The program will execute and perform the following steps:

Move itself to memory.
Start a new background process named "AAAA".
Connect the new process to the specified ngrok tunnel.
Customize the code as needed:

Modify the ngrokUrl variable to match the actual ngrok tunnel URL you want to connect to.
Add any additional functionality or modifications based on your requirements.
Important Notes
Ensure that you exercise caution and use this code responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
The code assumes that you have the necessary dependencies and tools installed on your Windows system, such as g++.
Make sure to modify the ngrokUrl variable in the code to match the actual ngrok tunnel URL you want to connect to.
